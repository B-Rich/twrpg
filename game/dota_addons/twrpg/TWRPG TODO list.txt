-- Backup ideas --
For crit-like abilities roll the dice and then apply the modifier during the OnAttack
but before the roll remove old modifiers so that it can work with extremely slow attack speeds

-- Specific -- 
Elementalist
	Add ability power scaling for all abilities(including summons)
	Fix Dreamgate wisp AI
	Remove Dreamgate wisp abilities and give them flying movement
	Add Dreamgate Earth Elemental special summon ability
	Fix summon armor scaling -- requires a workshop update, functions handling that are broken
	Water Blessing should grant 40% mana
	Change summon searching to modifier based(on creation apply a modifier specific to the element) -- to differentiate between summons
	Change the searching algorithm to searching by unit name + comparing unit owner -- to find the actual summons
	Add floating healing numbers for Purification

Martial Artist
	Create particle effect for all abilities
	Add tooltips and spell descriptions
	#Create Nameless arts ability
	Polish up the interactions between the MA abilities
